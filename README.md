Project Choice #5 Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Sensor Data

Motivation: 
* We are motivated to gain an intuition about the impacts of data on machine learning from understanding how data heterogeneity affects federated learning.
* One of us is currently working an honors thesis relating to federated learning
* Has a security component (performing adversarial attacks) which is interesting

Design goal:
* Characterize the impact of heterogeneity on FL. Then doing the same characterization under adversarial conditions.

Deliverables::
* Implementations of FL with different datasets and different levels of heterogeneity and characterizing them
* Characterization of FL after some adversarial attacks
* Comparisons between the adversarial vs non-adversarial settings and the impact of heterogeneity on them

System blocks:

HW requirement:
* Computer with CUDA-enabled GPU/ Google Collab

SW requirement:
* Python

Team Member lead roles:
